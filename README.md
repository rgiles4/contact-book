# Contact Book
This is a repository for my Contact Book Python project. It is a side-project that I am working on
to better understand Python as a language as I am not familiar with it.

## Functionality
This program reads from a .csv file named contact_book.csv. The file is created if it does not already exist when
the program is run.

Users currently can Add and Delete contacts from the file.

## CI/CD
I do not intend to perform a proper "Continuous Delivery" development cycle, however PyTest and GitHub Actions
will be used to ensure functionality of the program.
